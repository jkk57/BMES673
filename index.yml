authors: Shanmathi Sivakumar, Jaime K. Kerr
abstract: In this paper, we aim to model the biochemical kinetics of non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) in double-stranded breaks (DSBs) generated by low-LET radiation. 
A system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations, consisting of induction of DSBs by radiation and NHEJ major components 
(Ku7080, DNA-PKcs, LiIV) were utilized to model the subsequent induction of ùõæ-H2AX foci observed after LET radiation exposure. 
In a two step model of NHEJ, the first step allows the major components of NHEJ access to DSB and the second step occurs at a much 
slower rate with access limited to LiIV. This slower rate is assumed to be based on complex DSBs.  Simple and complex DSB, 
Simple DSBs and remaining DSBs over time post-radiation were modeled and plotted to compare with experimental data. 
Parameter sensitivity and parameter scan with respect to equilibrium concentrations of DSBs. were also performed.
